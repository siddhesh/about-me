# About Me

This repository houses the LaTeX source of my resume, where me/my, etc refer to
Siddhesh Poyarekar.  The LaTeX template is not original and was originally
created by Jason Blevins; the notice is in about-me.tex.  You may continue to
use this modified document as a template as mentioned in the copyright notice;
make sure you change all of the non-markup content so that you don't end up
impersonating me ;)
